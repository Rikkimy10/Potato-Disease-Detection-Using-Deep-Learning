# Potato-Disease-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning


# Project Overview:
This project focused on developing an image classification model to detect and classify common potato leaf diseases from images. Accurate and early disease detection is crucial in agriculture to prevent yield loss and improve crop management. By leveraging deep learning, the model provides a scalable and efficient solution for identifying disease patterns that can help farmers take timely action.

# Project Purpose:
The primary goal of this project was to build an automated system that could assist agricultural stakeholders—such as farmers, agronomists, and researchers—in identifying specific diseases affecting potato crops. Early and accurate detection through image analysis helps in implementing targeted treatments and reducing the economic impact of crop diseases.

# Tools and Technologies Used:

TensorFlow: Employed as the main deep learning framework for building and training the CNN model.
Python: Used for data processing, image manipulation, and scripting model training and evaluation.
OpenCV and PIL: Utilized for image preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
Jupyter Notebook: Aided in iterative model development, visualization, and documentation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization tools used to plot training/validation curves, confusion matrices, and model performance metrics.

# Key Achievements:

High Classification Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy in classifying multiple potato leaf diseases, showing the model’s robustness in distinguishing between healthy and diseased leaves.
Efficient Data Augmentation: Implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of training data, which improved model generalizability and reduced overfitting.
Model Optimization: Conducted hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance, adjusting parameters like learning rate, batch size, and layer configurations.
Scalability for Deployment: Developed a model that could be scaled for use in mobile or edge devices for real-time disease detection in field settings.

# Process Overview:

Data Collection: Utilized a dataset of potato leaf images, including various classes like healthy leaves and leaves affected by diseases such as early blight and late blight.

Data Preprocessing:

Image Resizing: Standardized all images to a fixed resolution for uniform input to the CNN model.
Normalization: Scaled pixel values to improve convergence during training.
Data Augmentation: Applied transformations such as rotation, flipping, and cropping to artificially expand the dataset and enhance model resilience.
Model Architecture: Built a CNN model with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers optimized for image classification tasks.
Experimented with different architectures and layer configurations to improve accuracy and reduce computation time.
Training and Validation:

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Trained the model on the training set while monitoring performance on the validation set to prevent overfitting.
Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for evaluation, optimizing the model based on validation results.

Evaluation and Tuning:
Evaluated the model on a test dataset, analyzing misclassified images to identify patterns and further refine the model.
Adjusted hyperparameters and model architecture iteratively, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Deployment Preparation:
Prepared the model for deployment by converting it to a TensorFlow Lite model, enabling compatibility with mobile and edge devices for potential real-world use in the field.

# Project Impact: 
This project demonstrates the ability to apply deep learning techniques to real-world agricultural challenges. The CNN model could significantly aid in reducing the labor and time required for disease diagnosis, thereby contributing to more sustainable farming practices. It also lays the foundation for further research into multi-crop disease classification and precision agriculture applications.
